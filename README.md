# CodeAlpha_StockTradingPlatform
CodeAlpha Java Programming Internship Task 2

A console-based Java application that simulates stock market trading, enabling users to buy, sell, and track stocks in real time with a virtual portfolio.
Features:
 - View a list of available stocks with current prices
 - Buy and sell stocks with virtual funds
 - Track portfolio performance and balance updates
 - Price updates simulated for a dynamic market feel
 - Clean OOP-based design for scalability and maintainability
 - Uses ArrayList and HashMap for storing stock data and user portfolios

This project showcases Java programming, data handling, and basic financial logic while simulating a realistic trading experience without connecting to live markets.
